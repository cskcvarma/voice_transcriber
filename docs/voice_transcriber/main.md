# `main` Module

Provides a simple entry point that transcribes `audio/interview.m4a` and creates chunks in the `output` directory. This is also exposed as the console script `voice_transcriber`.

Run from the command line:

```bash
uv pip install -e .[dev]  # once per environment
uv run voice_transcriber
```
